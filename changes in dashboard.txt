Model selection and state
Move/duplicate model selector into header; sync with sidebar; show dataset badge and metrics tooltip.
Persist last-used dataset/model and restored form values in localStorage.
Empty/loading/error states
Use skeletons for model cards, feature grid, and comparison list while fetching.
Replace raw error text with friendly inline error components and retry actions.

Visual analytics
Add charts for probability distribution, confidence over time, and per-model comparison (bar/sparkline) using Chart.js or ECharts.
SHAP/LIME visuals: waterfall/bar charts for top features; link bars to highlight corresponding inputs.

ARIA live regions
Announce prediction results and errors using aria-live polite/assertive near results.
Keyboard and focus
Ensure full keyboard flow (feature search, tabs, actions) with visible focus; escape closes slide-over.
Optional opt‑in shortcuts in Settings (e.g., Enter to Predict, Alt+M model menu).

Performance and resilience
Perceived performance
Virtualize large feature lists; debounce inputs; lazy load model grids/charts; prefetch on hover.
Network resilience
Offline indicator with retry/backoff UI; retain last result for context; compress/stream large responses if applicable.
Web Workers (optional)
Offload large chart transforms or client-side computations to avoid main-thread jank.









Larger tap targets and form density toggle.

Replace result block with a sticky badge + inline status ribbon; add aria-live.
