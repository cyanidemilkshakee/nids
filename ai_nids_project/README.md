# AI Network Intrusion Detection System (AI_NIDS)

Modern, data-driven intrusion detection pipeline with a REST API, interactive dashboard, explainability, feedback capture, and optional incremental updates. The primary supported dataset (as currently wired into the API) is **UNSW-NB15**; the codebase also contains utilities that can be extended for CICIDS or additional datasets.

## 3. Data Pipeline Overview
1. Preprocess UNSW / CICIDS (merges train+test, scales numeric, encodes labels) -> `data/processed/*_processed.csv`.
2. Feature selection script reduces dimensionality and writes `*_selected_features.csv` (and feature names JSON).
3. Training script (`train/train.py`):
   - Loads processed (selected) dataset.
   - Optional synthetic augmentation (if file exists or GAN env flags used).
   - Trains RandomForest (n=400 trees) with class balancing.
   - Saves model + metrics + canonical feature order.
4. API loads model + `feature_names.json` ensuring consistent feature index order for predictions & presets.

---
## 4. Models Included
### 4.1 RandomForest (Primary)
Trained via `train/train.py` with:
* n_estimators: 400
* class_weight: balanced (computed from data distribution)
* Stored at: `models/saved_model.joblib`
* Feature order persisted in `models/feature_names.json`

### 4.2 Adversarial / Deep Model
File: `models/saved_model_adversarial.keras` (Keras format) – currently **not** wired into the API endpoints (only sklearn/joblib model path supported). To integrate, extend `load_model_and_features` with a TF/Keras branch.

### 4.3 CNN & Ensemble Scripts
* `train/cnn_model.py` – prototype CNN training (for experimentation)
* `train/ensemble.py` – possible voting/stacking logic
Not currently deployed by Flask; adapt `DATASETS` mapping to add additional model entries.

### 4.4 Incremental Update Path
Endpoint `/incremental/update` attempts to reuse the existing stored model, performing a `partial_fit` if supported (SGD fallback logic). RandomForest (sklearn) is not inherently incremental; switch to `SGDClassifier` or similar for fully online learning in a production scenario.

---
## 5. Label Mapping (UNSW-NB15)
Current API `DATASETS` mapping (in `api/app.py`) uses:
```
0: Normal
1: Analysis
2: Backdoor
3: DoS
4: Exploits
6: Fuzzers
7: Generic
8: Reconnaissance
9: Worms
```
Note: Index 5 is intentionally absent (some UNSW label configurations skip a class depending on the subset available). The sampling & prediction logic tolerates this gap. If you need to re-align labels, regenerate preprocessing and update the `label_map` accordingly.

## 6. API Endpoints
Base URL (default): `http://localhost:5000`

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/` | Service status + supported datasets |
| GET | `/datasets` | Compact dataset list + label maps |
| GET | `/model_meta` | Rich metadata (features count, metrics, confusion matrix) |
| GET | `/features/<dataset>` | Ordered feature names required for prediction |
| POST | `/predict` | Perform inference on a single feature vector |
| POST | `/feedback` | Submit feedback (correct / false_positive / false_negative, etc.) |
| POST | `/preset/sample` | NEW: Return a real sample (optionally filtered by label) |
| POST | `/explain/shap` | Top feature contributions (global approximation for instance) |
| POST | `/explain/lime` | Local surrogate explanation (if LIME installed) |
| POST | `/incremental/update` | Attempt incremental training using feedback file |
| GET | `/status` | Health snapshot (cache counts, feedback rows) |
| GET | `/dashboard/` | Serves the HTML UI |

### 6.1 Prediction Request / Response
Request:
```json
{
  "dataset": "unsw",
  "features": [0.0, 0.12, 0.03, ...]
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "prediction": 3,
  "threat": "DoS",
  "confidence": 0.9471,
  "probabilities": {"0": 0.02, "3": 0.9471, "7": 0.01, "8": 0.01},
  "is_attack": true,
  "feature_order": ["dur", "sbytes", ...],
  "model_type": "sklearn"
}
```

### 6.2 Preset Sampling
Fetch real feature vectors to eliminate synthetic preset drift:
```http
POST /preset/sample
{
  "dataset": "unsw",
  "label": 3
}
```
Returns aligned `features` array in the canonical order for direct prediction.

### 6.3 Feedback
```json
{
  "features": [...],
  "predicted_label": 3,
  "feedback_label": "correct"
}
```
Appends a line to `data/feedback.csv`. Incremental update can consume only rows marked `correct`.

---
## 7. Real-Data Presets (Why They Matter)
Older heuristic presets produced unrealistic distributions → poor or confusing predictions. The new `/preset/sample` endpoint pulls genuine, scaled examples from the processed dataset and aligns them with the trained model’s feature order. The dashboard now:
* Lists each threat class as a clickable chip.
* Requests a real sample for that label.
* Populates the form precisely without manual value heuristics.
* Provides a random sample when the “Random” preset is used (`random: true`).

---
## 8. Explainability
| Technique | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| SHAP | `shap.TreeExplainer` fallback to KernelExplainer | Aggregates absolute mean importance across classes |
| LIME | `lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer` | Requires LIME dependency; samples up to 500 background rows |

Both endpoints return trimmed lists of feature contributions suitable for UI display. For full plots, extend the code to save HTML artifacts per request (currently not implemented for API responses).

---
## 9. Incremental Learning Caveats
The stored RandomForest model is not intrinsically incremental. The incremental path is opportunistic:
* Loads existing model; if it exposes `partial_fit` (e.g., switched to SGDClassifier in a future revision) it applies updates.
* Otherwise returns an error.
To fully leverage online learning, retrain using an incremental-friendly algorithm and persist that model instead.

## 10. Running the System (Windows Examples)
### 10.1 Install Dependencies
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure any optional libraries (e.g. `lime`, `shap`) are present if you want explainability endpoints.

### 10.2 Start API (serves dashboard)
```cmd
python api\app.py
```
Visit: http://localhost:5000/dashboard/

### 10.3 Test API
```cmd
python test_api.py
```

### 10.4 Sample cURL Prediction
```cmd
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"dataset\":\"unsw\",\"features\":[0,0,0]}"
```
(Use the exact feature length returned by `/features/unsw`).

## 11. Adding Another Dataset (High-Level Steps)
1. Preprocess & scale -> produce `data/processed/<name>_selected_features.csv` and feature list JSON.
2. Train a model -> save into `models/` as `<name>_model.joblib` and update `feature_names.json` if shared or create a dataset-specific feature list loader path.
3. Extend `DATASETS` in `api/app.py` with:
```python
DATASETS["<name>"] = {
  "model_path": "../models/<file>.joblib",
  "feature_path": "../data/processed/<file>.csv",
  "label_map": { ... }
}
```
4. Restart API. Frontend auto-populates dataset select + labels.

---
## 12. Docker (Baseline)
`Dockerfile` is present. Typical build/run:
```cmd
docker build -t ai_nids .
docker run -p 5000:5000 ai_nids
```
Adjust for production: multi-stage build, non-root user, pinned dependency versions, healthcheck, and optional volume mounts for models/logs.

---
## 13. Metrics & Monitoring
* `models/metrics.json` persists evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix) and an `online_accuracy` updated after each prediction (placeholder logic—treats every prediction as correct unless feedback indicates otherwise in future extensions).
* `/status` returns lightweight operational stats (cache sizes, feedback count).

---
## 14. Security Considerations (To Address in Production)
| Area | Recommended Action |
|------|--------------------|
| Input Validation | Enforce numeric ranges & schema for feature vectors |
| Auth | API keys / OAuth / mTLS for protected deployments |
| Rate Limiting | Mitigate brute-force / abuse scenarios |
| Data Integrity | Sign or hash model & feature list assets |
| Feedback Sanitization | Guard against CSV injection / payload tampering |

---
## 15. Known Gaps / Future Enhancements
* True multi-dataset support in runtime (currently only `unsw` is configured).
* Keras / DL model serving path.
* Richer frontend analytics (time trends, confusion matrix visualization).
* Database-backed feedback store (replace CSV) + retraining trigger pipeline.
* Unit & integration test coverage expansion.
* OpenAPI / Swagger documentation generation.

---
## 16. Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| 400: feature length mismatch | Frontend/sample mismatch | Reload features with the Refresh button; ensure preset uses new sample endpoint |
| SHAP fails for non-tree model | Explainer fallback limitations | Install correct SHAP version; consider KernelExplainer sample size tuning |
| LIME endpoint error | lime not installed | `pip install lime` |
| Incremental update error | Model lacks `partial_fit` | Replace model with incremental-friendly estimator |
| Wrong threat label | Label map misalignment | Regenerate preprocessing + update `DATASETS` mapping |
